2. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, what recommendations would you make to prospective ISNE students? (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** 

It was a long time since I have attended Information Systems and Network Engineering; ISNE. I could have never thought that I would be sitting here, doing your homework in just a few minutes. At first, I think I am not capable of being a programmer, and attending this course is a wrong choice. However, after I learned for a semester, my grades are beyond my expectations. I am really good at communication, and I was also chosen to be the leader (President) of this year ISNE students as a representative. Now, for me, ISNE is not really a major nor studying field, it is a family.
